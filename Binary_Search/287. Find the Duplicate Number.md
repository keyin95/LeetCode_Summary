### [287. Find the Duplicate Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/)
There are two methods to crack this problem.
* 1) Numbers are from [1,n]. The index range is [0,n]. So starting from the first one, when we use that number as the next index, we won't get into
Arrayindexoutofbounds Exception. And once we have a duplicate number, it will be acting like the entry of circle. So we can use methods from cycled
Linkedlist to find the entry of circle (duplicate number)

*Notice:* Slow pointer would begin with 0 not nums[0] since we need to consider the length from the start. 

* 2) Use Binary Search since the array can't be monotonically increasing. There must be some point where x <= val would be more than x.
We need to find the entry of that point.
```java
//method1: Cycle LinkedList
    public int findDuplicate(int[] nums) {
        int slow = nums[0];
        int fast = nums[nums[0]];
        
        while(slow != fast){
            slow = nums[slow];
            fast = nums[nums[fast]];
        }
        
        slow = 0;
        while(slow != fast){
            slow = nums[slow];
            fast = nums[fast];
        }
        
        return slow;       
    }
    
    //method2: Binary Search
    public int findDuplicate(int[] nums) {
        int start = 0;
        int end = nums.length-1;
        
        while(start + 1 < end){
            int mid = start + (end - start)/2;
            if(count(nums, mid) <= mid){
                start = mid;
            }else{
                end = mid;
            }
        }
        
        return end;
    }
    
    private int count(int[] nums, int mid){
        int count = 0;
        for(int i: nums){
            if(i <= mid) count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
```
