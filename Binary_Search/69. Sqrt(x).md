### [69. Sqrt(x)](https://leetcode.com/problems/sqrtx/)<a name="69. Sqrt(x)"></a>
Using Binary Search, here at least `start + 1 < end` the method will go into loop. So value less than 2 needs to be listed separately. 

<strong> NOTICE: </strong> `mid * mid` needs to be casted to long type, otherwise it might go overflow. Integers are truncated with the smaller one, so return the `start`.
```java
class Solution {
    public int mySqrt(int x) {
        if(x < 2) return x;
        
        int start = 0;
        int end = x;
        while(start + 1 < end){
            int mid = start + (end - start)/2;
            long subRes = (long)mid * mid;
            if(subRes < x){
                start = mid;
            }else if(subRes == x){
                return mid;
            }else{
                end = mid;
            }
        }
        return start;
    }
}
```
