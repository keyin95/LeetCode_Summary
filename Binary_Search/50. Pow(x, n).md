### [50. Pow(x, n)](https://leetcode.com/problems/powx-n/)
n can be odd or even. 
* If it's even, we could cut it half and only calcute the half value and double.
* If it's odd, we need to apply extra one to the result.

n < 0 or n == 0 needs to be considered separtely. Can't build the conversion process inside of myPow method. Otherwise will converse the
sub result as well.
```java
class Solution {
    public double myPow(double x, int n) {
        if(n == 0) return 1;
        return n > 0 ? fastPow(x, n): 1/(fastPow(x,n));
    }
    
    private double fastPow(double x, int n){
        if(n == 0) return 1;
        double half = fastPow(x, n/2);
        if(n%2 == 0) return half*half;
        else return half*half*x;
    }
}
```
