### [278. First Bad Version](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-bad-version/)
Here needs to find the first bad version, which is the left boundary of 1.
Imagine the version we have are actually like: e.g. 00011111
We could narrow down choices to be 2 elements and check it separately. (Applied to elements length < 2 also)
```java
public class Solution extends VersionControl {
    public int firstBadVersion(int n) {
        int start = 1;
        int end = n;
        while(start + 1 < end){
            int mid = start + (end-start)/2;
            if(isBadVersion(mid) == true) end = mid;
            else start = mid;
        }
        
        return isBadVersion(start) == true? start: end;
    }
}
```
