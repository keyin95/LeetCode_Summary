### [29. Divide Two Integers](https://leetcode.com/problems/divide-two-integers/)
There are multiple cases need to be considered here. First, the data is *unbalanced*, which means the absolute value of Integer.MIN_VALUE would be 1 greater than
the Integer.MIN_VALUE.

Corner Cases:
* When Integer.MIN_VALUE/-1, we don't have corresponding result in the ranage of integer. Method returns Max_VALUE instead.
* When the divisor is 0, would be positive infinite result or negative
* When the dividend is 0, could directly return 0

Since the sign also needs to be considered, we could check sign before applying to any operation.
When getting the absolute value, need to convert to long for Integer.MIN_VALUE, otherwise it would go overflow.
Then we could double the divisor everytime (iteratively checking). Working good. No need to add one time per iteration.
```java
public int divide(int dividend, int divisor) {
        // corner cases
        if(dividend == 0) return 0;
        if(divisor == 0) return dividend > 0? Integer.MAX_VALUE:Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        if(dividend == Integer.MIN_VALUE && divisor == -1) return Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        
        boolean signR = false;
        //whether is +/-
        if(dividend >= 0 && divisor <= 0 || divisor >= 0 && dividend <= 0) signR = true;
        
        long a = Math.abs((long)dividend);
        long b = Math.abs((long)divisor);
        int res = 0;
        
        while(b <= a){
            int shift = 0;
            while(a-(b << shift) >= 0){
                shift++;
            }
            
            a -= b << (shift-1);  
            res += 1 << (shift-1);
        }
        
        return signR == true? -res:res;
        
    }
```
