### [374. Guess Number Higher or Lower](https://leetcode.com/problems/guess-number-higher-or-lower/)
The number must be in the range of [1,n], so there will always be an answer. Just need to traverse by binary search to find the target.
*NOTICE:* guess(mid) returns -1 if pick < num.
```java
public class Solution extends GuessGame {
    public int guessNumber(int n) {
        int start = 1;
        int end = n;
        while(start + 1 < end){
            int mid = start + (end-start)/2;
            if(guess(mid)  == 0) return mid;
            else if(guess(mid)  == -1) end = mid;
            else start = mid;
        }
        
        return guess(start) == 0? start: end;
    }
}
```
