### [153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/)
It can be rotated or it might not look like rotated (times % length == 0). In this case, we need to consider separately and the minumum value would be the first one.

On the other hand, if it was rotated, the start element would be greater than the last element (length >= 2)

Imagine the whole array was split into (>=  &  <) part. We can use this criteria to do Binary Search.
Reaching to the end, the result would always be the end since it was sorted.
```java
class Solution {
    public int findMin(int[] nums) {
        int start = 0;
        int end = nums.length-1;
        // if its rotated times % length == 0 / not rotated
        if(nums[start] <= nums[end]) return nums[start];
        
        while(start + 1 < end){
            int mid = start + (end-start)/2;
            if(nums[mid] >= nums[0]){
                start = mid;
            }else if(nums[mid] < nums[0]){
                end = mid;
            }
        }
        
        return nums[end];
    }
    
}
```
